# DEPI-Final-Project

This penetration test was conducted on DC-9, a Linux-based virtual machine. The
goal was to identify security weaknesses, exploit them to gain unauthorized
access, and escalate privileges to obtain full root control of the system. The test
focused on identifying both technical vulnerabilities and demonstrating real-world
exploitation techniques.

The test identified several critical vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, Local
File Inclusion (LFI), weak password policies, and misconfigured sudo
privileges, which allowed privilege escalation to root. This report details each
finding, provides step-by-step exploitation methodologies, and offers a range of
technical and strategic remediation recommendations to enhance the overall
security of the target system
